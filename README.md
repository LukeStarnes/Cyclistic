Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Analysis

In this case study, I assumed the role of a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. The aim of this project was to understand how members and casual riders use Cyclistic's bikes differently and to create data-led insights to support a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. I used Excel and SQL to clean and explore the data and created visualisations in Tableau to support compelling data insights.

Cyclistic's financial analysts determined that annual members generate significantly more profit compared to casual riders. To ensure the company's future success, the marketing director believes it is crucial to increase the number of annual memberships. With this goal in mind, the marketing analytics team seeks to gain insight into the differing patterns of bike usage between casual riders and annual members at Cyclistic.

To conduct our analysis, we used Cyclistic's bike trip data from 2022, which is publicly accessible here. The data has been provided by Motivate International Inc. and is subject to this license. The data is organized in spreadsheets for each month of the year, comprising a total of 12 .CSV files and a total of over 5 million rows. The data is structured, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. Every trip is identified by a unique field called ride_id and is anonymized.


The project consisted of six steps:
Step 1 (Ask): Guiding Questions
The guiding question in this analysis was, "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
Step 2 (Prepare): Understanding the Data
We analyzed Cyclistic's bike trip data from 2022. The data was clean, reliable, and error-free.
Step 3 (Process): Cleaning and Aggregating the Data
We cleaned and manipulated the data, merged data, created new columns, renamed columns, dropped erroneous rows, and checked for and fixed nulls.
Step 4 (Analyse): SQL Exploration
We explored the data using SQL, looking for trends or relationships and insights that help to solve the business task.
Step 5 (Share): Data Visualisations and Interactive Dashboard
  We created a series of dashboards showcasing the insights along with the following visualisations:
  Pie chart (User-type share)
  Bar graphs (Ride counts and average lengths per month, day)
  Start time heatmap
  Start station density map
  Most popular start station geographic plots by user type
Step 6 (Act): Findings
Based on the analysis, we discovered the following insights:
  Members make up a high proportion of riders in the winter months.
  Casual riders take significantly more rides in summer than winter.
  Members take shorter trips than casual riders.
  Members make more rides in the week, whilst casual riders account for a (slight) majority of rides on weekends.
  Ride patterns suggest that members are more likely to use Cyclistic bikes for commuting to work.
  The most popular stations for members are located in the downtown area.
  Casual riders are more likely to use stations in tourist areas and parks.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we suggest the following recommendations to increase the number of annual memberships:
  Seasonal marketing campaigns: Launch digital marketing campaigns in spring and summer, offering incentives and offers for riders buying annual memberships.
  Promote benefits of commuting to casual riders: Offer incentives and rewards for casual riders who become annual members and highlight the benefits of using Cyclistic's bikes for commuting to work.
  Location-based advertising: Casual riders begin most of their trips at stations close to major tourist sites, parks, and the coast. Cyclistic can capitalize on this by placing adverts around these stations promoting the benefits of annual membership plans.

Conclusion
By analyzing Cyclistic's bike trip data, we were able to gain insights into how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights can be used by Cyclistic's marketing team to create an effective marketing strategy to encourage casual riders to become annual members.
